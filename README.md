## Get ready for an action packed journey through the Cosmos while learning about Github Actions. â˜„ 
## Getting started

- If you do not have TwilioQuest downloaded you can download the game for free [here](https://www.twilio.com/quest)
- Download the latest stable version of Cosmos [here](https://github.com/Xlient/Cosmos/releases)

**NOTE:** TwilioQuest Extensions are only available from version 3.2 and onward. If you're on an older version of TwilioQuest extensions will not be supported

![Launcher for 3.2](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/twilioquest-prod.appspot.com/o/docs%2Flauncher-preview.png?alt=media&token=6aedd709-9ba2-4ab3-b935-2537a8f5ff2f)

### Enabling extensions

In the `Settings` UI (press the `3` key in-game), navigate to the `Extensions` submenu. Click the button there labeled `Enable Extensions`.

![Enable Extensions in the Settings UI](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/twilioquest-prod.appspot.com/o/docs%2Fenable-extensions.png?alt=media&token=8cc8e5ea-ee56-4a39-ae92-91add950b040)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** As indicated in the UI, make sure to only use extensions from trusted sources. Like "mods" from other games you may have played before (Minecraft, Skyrim, etc.), a TwilioQuest extension will be able to execute code on your computer. Exercise caution when installing an extension, just as you would using any third-party code on your computer.

Once you have enabled extensions, specify a folder on your computer where you will download and manage extensions. This should be the [full path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_name#Filenames_and_paths) to an empty folder on your computer (you should create such a folder first, if you haven't already). Next Extract the zip file you just donwloaded and place the folder in the directory that contains all TwilioQuest extensions

![Specify a folder path for extensions](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/twilioquest-prod.appspot.com/o/docs%2Fext-folder.png?alt=media&token=4936dd5c-d84c-459e-9179-4c545a64b297)

Once you have enabled extensions, you should see a listing of automatically-installed "base extensions", and a list of any extensions you have installed yourself. Now you are ready to play

Our last workflow was a good example of a basic workflow , However we don't want to create a file every time we push code right now. To fix that lets disable the workflow.

1. Navigate to the `Actions` tab in your forked repository
2. Click on your workflow 
3. Click on the  three dots `...` in the right hand corner
4. Press Disable

When your done click the _HACK_ button.

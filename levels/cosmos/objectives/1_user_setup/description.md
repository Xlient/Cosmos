Before you head off the ship, you’re going to need a few things.  The challenges that lie ahead will require you to have an existing account on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/).   If you don’t already have one you can join the community by   [creating a free account](https://github.com/join). In addition you'll need to create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) with the <code>workflow </code> scope checked or if creating a fine grained personal access token set the repository access to <code> Public Repositories</code>



Once you’re all set, enter your username and your personal access token in the boxes on the right and press _HACK_

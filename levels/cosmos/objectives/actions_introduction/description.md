## Continuous Intergration

[Continous Intergration](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration#about-continuous-integration) or CI is a practice of intergating or merging code changes from multiple developers in a repository regularly.This often triggers automated builds and tests to run. This is useful becuase its helps developers to avoid developers working in isolation and often helps idenify bugs in your code sooner. Continuously updating makes it easier to merge in changes verus all at once and reduces the time spend resolving merge conflicts.

## Continous Delivery

[Continous Delivery](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-continuous-delivery.html) or CD, allows developmetn teams to automatically build, tested and prepared to be release. Continous Delivery explands on Continous intergration by  taking all the code changes and deploying them to a testing environment and production (out to end users) after building.

"With CD, development teams can build, test, and release software faster and more frequently. As a result, they can reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering each change. A repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery."[^1]

## What are Github actions then?

 GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.
